# Maya_3D_Animation
This is a 3D animation created by me in Autodesk Maya. It contains a superhero like figure dropping a heavy ball from a building which creates an explosion on the ground. Video includes fluid camera movement, human figure which can be moved around willingly, crater explosion, a building and lighting around the scenery.

If you explore around the world created in Maya you can also go through the rooms in the building which, has its own personilaty. The room includes a bedroom which was inspired by my own bedroom
